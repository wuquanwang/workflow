Please download the DAX workflow archive from https://download.pegasus.isi.edu/misc/SyntheticWorkflows.tar.gz, 
unzip it and keep the DAX workflows in an appropriate position. 
Or, you can just use some workflow samples which have been already included in this project.

For each case, please set Evaluate.WORKFLOW_LOCATION to the directory where the workflows are stored before running the experiments.
